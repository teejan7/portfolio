# TEEJAN TEEPEE | Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio.

## About This Website

I created this site from scratch to represent my professional skills, educational journey, and ways to connect.  
The goal: give recruiters, collaborators, and visitors a clear, visual introduction without exposing my project code in public.

## How I Made It

- **Tech:** Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for design and animations.
- **Design:** Built a modern, UI/UX-focused single page with responsive styles, animated hero and timeline, and simple navigation.
- **Contact:** The site features a popup-enabled contact form (Formspree) with validation.  
- **Media:** All images, icons (FontAwesome), and layout assets are included for a professional look.
- **Deployment:** Ready for Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any static host.

## How to Use/See

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser for local preview.
- Share your live link after deployment (Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
- Use the site for resume, LinkedIn, or networking.
